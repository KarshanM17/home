          Zombs Royale is a 2D shooter game where you fight up to 100 other players to be the last one standing. There are many weapons like snipers, grenades, pistols, rifles, and even unique weapons like flamethrowers. I started playing this game since its release in 2018 and have two accounts to play on. I am soon going to create a YouTube channel to post my videos. I will link it here once I have created it.

            Since 2016, the world was taken over by Pokemon. Pokemon Go is a game where you catch many Pokemon with their released shiny variants, power them up and evolve them for battle against powerful raid bosses and/or trainers. The world of Pokemon has been a really large part of my childhood (since I was in JK). I feel like this game gives it a wonderful tribute to those memories I had watching Ash and his friends battle it out on TV. I will also post Pokemon Go content on my yet-to-be-made YouTube channel.

          <center>Speedcubing involves a great sense of precision and speed, both of which I possess. I can currently solve a cube sub-30 seconds. I am trying to achieve sub-10 seconds by the end of this year. I started cubing back when I was 11 years old, and I have been honing my skills since.</center>
