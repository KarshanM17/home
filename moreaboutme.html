<center><h3 id="title"> In this section, you will get to know more about me and a quick life story that I have never shared with anyone.</h3></center>

  <p id="blendtext"> I am a very academic student. This is all in hopes of becoming a very successful civil engineer, so I can build wonderful infrastructure for the underprivileged communties of (absurdly enough) the world. You may be wondering, "What is the point of spending 2 decades for a piece of paper that might not even be successful?" Now before you start throwing your tomatoes, I have two things two tell you. Firstly, I live by the Latin phrase, "Ego sum maximus." This means that I am the best. This self-confidence is what drives me. The second thing I would like to share is a quick story that I was lucky enough to be apart of. Keep reading to find out what this story did to me that was magical.</p>

  <p id="blendtext"> 
    In Grade 1, Coach Petra labeled me as a slowpoke in running windsprints in basketball, an assessment that fueled my determination and angered me for life. Racing against older kids, their overwhelming sweat odor was almost tangible. However, equipped with a flavored mouthguard, I soldiered on. Despite being dubbed a playmaker and getting drafted, I quit due to some bias and discrimination in the selection process, because of my skin colour.
      <br>
    Determined to prove my worth, I dedicated my summer to daily practice. Running against my dad and siblings on bikes, the initial weeks brought no victories. Yet, with unwavering persistence, I started securing consecutive 2nd or 3rd places, signaling progress.
      <br>
    Undoubtedly, the saga continued, painting a vivid picture of the transformative power of determination. I ended up making the cut for the next 3 seasons.   
      <br>
    As the seasons rolled on, my commitment to excellence deepened. The off-season became a canvas for refining my skills. Endless hours were spent honing every aspect of my game – from speed to precision. It wasn't just about outrunning opponents; it was about outsmarting them, anticipating their moves, and turning every play into a strategic conquest.
      <br>
    The summer practices against my family on bikes evolved into a fierce battleground. Each day, a new strategy was employed, a new technique tested. The taste of victory became addictive, and the hunger for success intensified.
      <br>
    Returning to the basketball court, I wasn't just a player; I was a force to be reckoned with. Coach Petra's skepticism transformed into awe as I consistently secured 15+ point nights easily, pushing my limits in every race. The pivotal moment came when the championship was within reach. The starting call echoed, and I propelled myself forward, leaving doubt in the dust. Leaving the basketball court with a dub wasn't just a personal triumph; it was a testament to the indomitable spirit of determination.
      <br>
    However, the story didn't end with a single victory. It became a narrative of continuous growth and evolution. The championship was a stepping stone, not a summit. I realized that determination wasn't a one-time effort but a lifestyle. It fueled my aspirations beyond the basketball court. In the corridors of my dreams, I envisioned becoming a civil engineer – a field where determination molds structures and shapes the world. Simultaneously, the echoes of my own anthem reverberated in my mind, pushing me towards the realm of songwriting and singing.
     <br>
    The story concludes not with a full stop but a comma, indicating the ongoing journey of a determined soul. The race against limitations is perpetual, and the taste of success only intensifies the hunger for greater achievements. Determination, in its unyielding form, becomes the guiding star in the constellation of aspirations, propelling one towards uncharted territories of excellence. This story is what keeps me going, and I am grateful for the opportunity, reminding me when times are tough, that I am here for a reason. A reason to live when living seems impossible at times.
