      <center><p id="blendtext">I'm a Grade 10 student born in Jaffna, Sri Lanka on August 17, 2008. I came to Toronto when I was around 8 months old and have remained in Toronto since. I have a mom, a dad, a sister, a brother and seven pet guppies in my family. I am really lucky to have a wonderful and loving family. I obviously won't keep rambling on and on about myself. Go on and explore more about me through this wonderful website I have put together. </center>
